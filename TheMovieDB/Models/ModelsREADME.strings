/*
 We will store all the models related to the controller. The Models class will be related to each component,
 as you can see in the Flow Diagram. It will be of type struct and mostly it will contain Request,
 Response, and ViewModel structs.
 
 SAMPLE CODE
 
 import UIKit
 
 struct TestModel{
     struct Fetch {
         struct Request
         {
             var itemId = 0
             var keyword: String?
             var count: String?
         }
         struct Response
         {
             var testObj: Test?
             var isError: Bool
             var message: String?
         }
         struct ViewModel
         {
             var name: String?
             var date: String?
             var desc: String?
             var isError: Bool
             var message: String?
         }
     }
 }
 
 For this example, letâ€™s assume you are working with an API call on this scene. You will need the following structs:
 
 Request - parameters that need to be sent to the API request.
 Response - intercepts the response from the API and stores the appropriate data.
 ViewModel - everything that you need to show to the UI is stored here. For example,
 your API returns objects with 10 parameters, but you only need to show 4 of them.
